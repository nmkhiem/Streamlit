# Streamlit Demo Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Streamlit Demo Project! This project showcases the capabilities of Streamlit by demonstrating three different applications:

1. **Edit Distance Calculation**: Allows users to input a word and calculates the edit distance (Levenshtein distance) between the given word and a predefined target word.
2. **Object Detection**: Enables users to upload an image, and performs object detection to identify and highlight objects within the image.
3. **Simple Chatbot**: A basic chatbot that interacts with users, providing responses based on predefined rules or a simple machine learning model.

Streamlit is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects, allowing you to create beautiful, custom web apps for your machine learning and data science projects with minimal effort. This project aims to demonstrate how Streamlit can be used to build interactive applications quickly and easily.
